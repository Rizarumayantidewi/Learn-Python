#No matter how complex a program is, it begins with a single line of code. This first line is usually a variable.
#Programs use variables to remember information. Like moving boxes, variables have content and names that tell us what's inside.
#1) Names
#To create a variable, we need to give it a name. Variable names need to be single words and therefore have no spaces. example :
home

#If we want a variable name with multiple words, we use snake case. Snake case means using _ to connect the additional words. example :
my_home

#To help us understand what's inside a variable we pick descriptive names. Example:
Home_city_province


#2) Values
#variable names can contain numbers, too. Adding numbers is useful for multiple similar variables. example:
hotel_1

#After creating and naming a variable, we use the = sign to store a value inside it. example :
hotel = "Dariza"

#When we store a value in a variable, it's like putting stuff inside a box. Example:
My_hotel = “Dariza”

#The values we've been storing, like "Riza" are strings. Strings are words in double quotes. Example:
“Riza”

#Strings can contain all sorts of letters and symbols, including spaces, example:
"Riza Rumayanti Dewi"


#3)Console
#Lines of code are instructions for the computer to follow. when we run code, we tell the computer to follow the instructions we put together.

#The order of the instructions matters because the computer follows the instructions line by line, Example:
Step_1 = “Like”
Step_2 = “Dear”
Step_3 = “Love”
	
#with the special instruction print(), we tell the computer to display a value in an area called the console, also known as the shell. Example:
print(“Salut!”)

#we can use the print() instruction as often as we want. The computer displays every value on a line in the console. Example:
print(“дорогая Риза”)
print("Bonjour")

#we can use print() to display variables. Example:
greeting = “Hai”
print(greeting)

#when we display variables in the console, their values appear instead of their names.if we print name here, it'll show its value. Example:
name = Riza
print(name)
