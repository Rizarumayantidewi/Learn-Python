#1)	We can use comparisons to check if a string is equal to or not equal to another string. Example:
Print(“online” == “online”)
Print(“online” != “offline”)

#To check if a string is equal to another string, we also use the equality operator == ,example:
Print(“grape” == “grape”)

#If the string on the left is equal to string on the right, as in “banana” == “banana” , the result is True ,example:
Print(“banana” == “banana”)

#If the string on the left isn’t equal to the string on the right, as in “banana” == “grape” , the result is False ,example:
Print(“banana” == “grape”)

#We can also compare variables that store strings with each other, like in fruit_1 == fruit_2 ,example:
fruit_1 = “banana”
fruit_2 = “grape”
print(fruit_1 == fruit_2)


#2)	to check if a string isn’t equal to another string, we use the inequality operator != ,example:
print(“Riza” != “Gilang”)

#If the left string isn’t equal to the right string, as in “Riza” != “Gilang” , the result is True ,example:
Print(“Riza” == “Gilang”)

#If the string on the left is equal to the string on the right, as in “banana” != “banana” , the result is False ,example:
Print(“banana” == “banana”)

#To store the result of a comparison in a variable, we use the = sign ,example:
Fruit = “grape” != “grape”

#We can also compare variables that store strings with each other, like in fruit_1 == fruit_2 ,example:
fruit_1 = “banana”
fruit_2 = “grape”
print(fruit_1 == fruit_2)
