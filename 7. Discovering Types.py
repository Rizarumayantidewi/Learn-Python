#1)	We’ve already seen a few kinds of data like numbers and strings. In programming terms, these values are called types.
Strings are characters between quites “” ,example:
Sugar_content = “High”

#Integer is another type we’ve already used. It represents whole numbers without decimals. Example:
Score = 25

#Float is another number type we use to describe numbers with one or more digits after the decimal point. Example:
Pie = 3.14159

#The type Boolean contains only two values : the special values True and False .We’ll store the value True inside this variable. Example:
Received_newsletter = True

#When storing False in is_on ,we say that we assign a value to a variable. Example:
Is_on = False

#Assign a string to the name variable, an integer to age ,and a Boolean to is_active ,example:
Name = “Kai”
Age = 27
Is_active = True
